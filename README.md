# ASU Brand Maker

Description:
	Small module for the creation of the ASU Header/Footer menu systems.

Instructions:
	Add the module to a Drupal site and enable it. On install, the module will automatically create 
	the necessary content type and it's fields.

	From there just create a new piece of content(Brand Header). A UI will appear in the content creation
	window. Click on the uppermost "+" to add top level elements. Each element's "+" adds child elements
	beneath it. Each "-" removes that element.

	Typing information into the boxes updates the preview and the JSON block beneath in real time.

	Once you are happy with the menu just save it.
